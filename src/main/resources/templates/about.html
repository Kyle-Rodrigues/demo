        <h1>An inspirational story from the jungle...</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, deep in the heart of the jungle, a group of gorillas stumbled upon a strange device. It was a computer, abandoned by a group of researchers who had been studying the gorillas. The gorillas were curious and one of them, a curious young gorilla named Kiki, began to experiment with the device.</p>

        <p>    To her surprise, she discovered that the computer could understand commands that she typed on the keyboard. Kiki quickly became obsessed with learning more about this mysterious new technology. She spent all of her free time tinkering with the computer and learning as much as she could. </p>
            
        <p>    As the months passed, Kiki's knowledge of the computer grew and she began to teach her fellow gorillas what she had learned. They were fascinated by the new technology and soon, a group of gorillas who were experts in coding in springboot emerged in the jungle. </p>
            
        <p>    As they continued to learn, the gorillas realized that they could use their new skills to improve their own lives and the lives of the other animals in the jungle. They began to create programs to help them find food more efficiently and to track the movements of other animals to avoid dangerous predators. </p>
            
        <p>    The other animals in the jungle were amazed by the gorillas' newfound abilities and they began to rely on the gorillas' programs to help them survive. The jungle became a better place for all of its inhabitants and the gorillas, once known only for their strength and aggression, became respected for their intelligence and problem-solving skills. </p>
            
    <p>    Thanks to Kiki's curiosity and her determination to learn, the gorillas of the jungle had found a new way to thrive in the wild. And they all lived happily ever after, coding in Spring Boot.</p>
